# Deployment Document for Godot Game

## Overview
This game script is designed in **Godot Engine** and involves quick-time events (QTE), where the player has to press a random key within a limited time frame. The game tracks the score and the high score, while providing animations and sound effects. It also includes a "Restart" feature for the user to replay the game.

---

## Pre-deployment Requirements
Before deploying this game, ensure the following requirements are met:

### Software Requirements:
- **Godot Engine** (version 4.3 or later)
- **Operating System**: Windows (untested on macOS or Linux)

### Hardware Requirements:
- **Minimum System Specs**: Moderate CPU and GPU capable of running basic 2D games.
- **Storage**: Sufficient disk space for the Godot project and all associated assets.

### Dependencies:
- No external dependencies beyond Godot Engine and internal assets (audio, animation, etc.).

### Configuration:
- Ensure the `Global` singleton script exists and contains the variable `high_score` for saving high scores.
- Verify the assets referenced in the script (like `$Crowd`, `$EarthGone`, `$ButtonToPress`, `$ProgressBar`, `$Restart`, and `$High Score`) are named correctly in the scene tree.
- Ensure sound files and animation files/nodes used in the script (such as `deltarune-explosion.mp3`, `kirby.png`, and `$AnimationPlayer`) are present in the project.
- There should be **5** mp3 files in the Sounds folder (10 including the .import files)
- There should be **6** png files in the Sprites folder (12 including the .import files)
- Ensure the `kirby-super-star-dialogue.ttf` font is properly rendering

## Deployment Steps
### 1. Prepare the Project for Deployment:
- Ensure the Godot project is saved and all necessary assets (textures, animations, sounds, and scripts) are included in the project folder.
- Ensure the `Global` script is created, containing a variable for storing high scores.

### 2. Set Up the Godot Project:
- open the vibecode_godot folder and import the **project.godot** file into the **Godot editor** to run the game as a Godot project
- Navigate to the **Project Settings** and configure export settings for desired platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.). (optional)
- If deploying to a platform like **HTML5**, ensure that the game is optimized for browser use. (optional)

### 3. Testing the Game:
- **Run the game** in the Godot editor to test basic functionality (key press detection, score tracking, animations, etc.).
- Verify that the game runs without errors in both editor and exported modes.
- Test for:
  - Key press recognition (`$ButtonToPress` text updates).
  - Timer functionality (`$QTE Timer`).
  - Score updates and high score functionality.
  - Animation and sound effects during the game.

### 4. Build the Game (Optional):
- Navigate to **Project** → **Export** in Godot.
- Select the target platform(s) (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS).
- Click **Export Project** to generate the game build.

### 5. Post-deployment Testing:
- After export, test the game on the target platform(s) to verify proper functionality.
- Ensure that all components (key press events, animations, progress bar updates, and score tracking) behave as expected in the final build.
- Test on different screen resolutions to ensure UI elements (buttons, progress bars) are properly displayed.

## Rollback Plan
If the deployment fails or there are issues after deployment, you can roll back to a previous version by:

1. **Backup**: Maintain a backup of the previous stable version of the project and build files.
2. **Restore**: Revert the project to the backup version and re-export the game.
3. **Version Control**: Use Git or another version control system to track and revert changes to the project.

---

## Testing and Validation
After deployment, perform the following tests:

1. **Input Tests**: Confirm that random key press events work properly and the player can press keys within the required time limit.
2. **Progress Bar**: Validate that the progress bar correctly reflects the countdown and the user can see it fill up and deplete.
3. **Animations**: Verify that the game animations play correctly based on score and other triggers.
4. **Score Calculation**: Ensure that the score is updated properly after each correct key press, and that the final score is displayed when the game ends.
5. **High Score Storage**: Confirm that the high score is stored correctly in the `Global` variable and displayed in the UI.

---

## Security Considerations
Since this game is primarily a single-player, local game with no external data connections, security concerns are minimal. However, consider:

1. **Data Privacy**: Ensure that no sensitive personal information is being collected from users.
2. **File Integrity**: Use version control and backups to maintain the integrity of the game files.

---

## Post-deployment Monitoring and Maintenance
Once deployed, monitor the game for any user feedback related to:

- **Bug reports** related to gameplay (e.g., input bugs, UI glitches).
- **Performance issues** on specific devices or platforms.
- **User feedback** regarding the difficulty of the game, animations, or other mechanics.

Regularly check for updates to the Godot engine or any dependencies used in the game, and apply patches or updates as necessary.

---

## Release Notes
- The game includes a **score tracking system** and **randomized key press events**.
- The game features **progress bars** and **animations** to enhance the user experience.
- A **high score** system is implemented, where the player’s best score is saved and displayed.

---

## Additional Considerations
- Ensure that any **external libraries** or custom scripts (like the `Global` script for high score tracking) are properly documented and integrated into the project.

This document should ensure that the deployment process is smooth and provides a clear guide to getting the game running successfully in production.
