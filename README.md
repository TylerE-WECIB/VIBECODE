What did you build?
- I programmed a kirby quick time event simulator. (Similar to the Super Star Megaton Punch. I used the same assets from that game)
- Hit the corresponding keyboard button before the timer runs out!!

What language(s) or tools did you use?
- Godot / GDScript, as well as various websites like EzGif and Cobalt.tools
  
Which AI tools did you use, and how?
- I used ChatGPT and Phind for planning and research, as well as avoiding specific tedious code like creating a list of every letter, number, and symbol.

What did you do versus what AI helped with?
- I did 99% of the work because I struggle to implement AI into my workflow in a way that doesn't feel incredibly forced and detracts from the vibe. (Especially in Godot)
- The biggest AI generated code that ended up in my work was the aformentioned list because I really didn't feel like typing all of that.
- I did reference Phind at the beginning for planning the overall project, but the result was terminal based and I didn't want to spend time fighting with it when the logic is simple enough for me to handle on my own.
- Godot afaik doesn't really have strong AI integration, and ChatGPT wanted me to code the scripts in VSCode (no) so I also kinda had to do most of the work anyway.
- In situations where I needed to use an external tool, like to remove a background, download a sound, or crop a spritesheet, there were often specialist websites that I trust to handle the job better.

What’s one thing you’re proud of?
- I kept the project scope under control and managed to produce a feature-complete game in the time limit.

What’s one thing you’d improve with more time?
- I'd make the timing after 395 Mt. a little more lenient. It cuts down to 0.1 seconds and it's basically impossible to keep playing unless you get extremely lucky.
